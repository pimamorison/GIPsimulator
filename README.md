# GIPsimulator
This repository contains code for simulating group identification problems. In the file GIP.py you will find several functions useful for Group Identification Problems, such as functions for simulating all possible profiles or all possible opinions. In addition, you can find sever Aggregation Rules in this file, which take as an input a profile of agents and produce a vector of selected agents as output.

The file jpetpref.py contains code for running a simulation that uniformly generates random profiles and calculates the frequency of strategic manipulation.
